This module provides interferace to the google cloud platform's speech recognition api. 

IMPORTANT POINTS:

1. Google Cloud Speech Recognition API need an API Key for authentication of the requesting device
2. This API key must be stored in the 'speech_google_config.txt' against the 'api key' field.
3. The API key is generated on the google cloud platform and provided with appropriate permissions for the speech recognition process.
   ( For more information on the google speech recognition api, refer to the google cloud platform's official documentation)

|___speech
|   | TYPE: CLASS
|   | DESCIPTION: This class contains the functions to communicate will the google cloud platform speech api. This class has functions to 
|   |             perform speech recognition using google cloud speech api.
|   |             (For more information on these actions see the google cloud speech api documentation)
|   |
|   |
|   |___ _URL,_RESOURCE,_HEADERS
|   |      TYPE: CLASS VARIABLEs
|   |      DESCRIPTION: These variables hold google speech api SERVICE endpoint. These are used when making https resquests to perform
|   |                   speech recognition when using the module. If you provide incorrect api key 'speech_google_config.txt' file
|   |                   the servers will respond with an error code which will be reflected by the function's return value 0.
|   |
|   |___ code
|   |      TYPE: CLASS VARIABLE
|   |      DEFAULT VALUE: It is assigned the value in the language parameter of the class constructor.
|   |      DESCRIPTION: This variable contains the google language code of language in which the user will communicate with the system
|   |                   It's value is extracted from the speech_google_config.txt file. 
|   |
|   |
|   |___ responseString
|   |      TYPE: CLASS VARIABLE
|   |      DEFAULT VALUE: as returned by processString function
|   |      DESCRIPTION: This variable holds the response String returned by GCP speech api after calling the sendAudio() function. 
|   |
|   |______ response
|   |        TYPE: CLASS VARIABLE
|   |        DEFAULT VALUE: as returned by processString function
|   |        DESCRIPTION: This variable is a python3 list of words in the response String returned by GCP speech api after calling the 
|   |                     sendAudio() function. 
|   |
|   |___  __init__()
|   |       TYPE: CLASS CONSTRUCTOR
|   |       PARAMETER: 
|   |         1. languages
|   |              DESCRIPTION: This variable holds the language code of the language to used. Language codes can be determined from google
|   |                           Speech API documentation.
|   |
|   |         2. apiKey
|   |              DESCRIPTION: This variable holds the speech api registered on your google cloud project. Correct Key should be passed to 
|   |                           to the constructor otherwise the module will fail 
|   |
|   |___ sendAudio()
|          TYPE: CLASS MEMBER FUNCTION
|          PARAMETER:
|            1. audiodata : this is bytes type string containing the audio data encoded in wav format
|          RETURNS:
|            0 if there is some error in making the https request
|              if server responds with error
|              if the response is of non stantard format
|            <text from audio> if everthing goes fine and there are no errors. The results from server are stored in 'response' and 
|                              'responseString' variables.
|          DESCRIPTION: This function accepts a bytes type audio data string, reads it's data bytes and sends it to the google cloud 
|                       platform speech api to convert it to text. If the server does not respond with an error message and
|                       everything goes fine then, the response and responseString class variables will store the text conversion.

|___ processString()
       TYPE: FUNCTION
       PARAMETER:
         1. st : a string variable
       RETURNS:
         (["failed"],"failed") if the string is not is the standard google speech api response format
         ([list of words in response text], response text) if everything goes fine
         

USAGE: It is recommended to create a global object of this class and call the sendAudio() function whenever the ocr is required.
